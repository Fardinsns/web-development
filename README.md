<h2 style="color:green;">Web Development Journal</h2>

A chronological collection of my web development projects and exercises.  
Each folder corresponds to a day of coding practice, e.g., <strong>day1</strong>, <strong>day2</strong>, etc.

- <strong>dayX/</strong>: Contains all files created on that day.

<h3 style="color:green;">Purpose</h3>

<h3 style="color:green;">How to Use</h3>

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fardinsns/web-development.git

This keeps it **clean, readable, and green** without any unnecessary complexity.  

If you want, I can also **add a tiny “auto-sync every hour” note in green** at the top to show that this repo updates itself — it’ll make your README slightly fancier but still super simple. Do you want me to add that?
