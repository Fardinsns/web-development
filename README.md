<h1 style="color:green;">Web Development Journal</h1>

A chronological collection of my web development projects, exercises, and practice files.  
This repository is designed to track my daily coding progress, store my work safely on GitHub, and provide a clear reference for learning web development over time.

This version is:  

- **Big enough** — detailed purpose, workflow, and tips  
- **Clean** — sections separated with headings and explanations  
- **Green headings** for style  
- **Practical** — someone else or future-you can immediately understand your repo  

If you want, I can **add a section for “Technologies Learned / Used”** where you list HTML, CSS, JS, or anything new each day — that’ll make the README even more professional but still simple.  

Do you want me to add that?
